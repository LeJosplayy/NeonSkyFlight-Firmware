## Getting Started üöÅ

### Prerequisites
1. **Hardware**:
   - Compatible Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno or Atmel AVR boards)
   - Sensors (e.g., gyroscope, accelerometer, compass)
   - Motors and ESCs for your drone
   
2. **Software**:
   - [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) for building and uploading firmware
   - Arduino IDE (optional, for quick tests)
   - [NeonSkyFligtGUI](https://github.com/LeJosplayy/NeonSkyFlight) for for route and task automation

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeJosplayy/NeonSkyFlight-Firmware.git
   cd NeonSkyFlight
2. **Configure your Drone**:
   ```bash
    config.h
3. **Upload Firmware: Modify the configuration file (platformio.ini) to match your microcontroller and board:**:
   ```bash
    [env:uno]
    platform = atmelavr
    board = uno
    framework = arduino
